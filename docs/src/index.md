SpeedMapping solves three types of problems:
1. Accelerating convergent mapping iterations
2. Solving non-linear systems of equations
3. Minimizing a function, possibly with box constraints
using two algorithms: [Alternating cyclic extrapolations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377042723005514) and [Anderson Acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_acceleration). With recently developed features, SpeedMapping [is competitive with similar Julia packages](https://nicolasl-s.github.io/SpeedMapping.jl/dev/benchmarks/).
